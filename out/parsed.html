    <h1>My new Blog!</h1>

<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>Since my first years of college, I always knew I would end up building my own blog from scratch.
What I didn't know, is that it would take me so long to start to do it!
But finally, I've decided to stop procrastinating it and start building it.
</p>
<p>Also since I've known the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust programming language</a>, I was sure I would end up building using it. I want to make it iteratively, starting with a minimal working version, without tags, comments etc. Just plain text, just a simple markdown to html. And whenever I want/have time, keep adding features.
</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>I've recently moved to Barcelona, to work for Amazon, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to create my own blog, and share some of my views. (Opinions are my own (?))
</p>
<h2>What will you write about?</h2>
<p>About anything, probably most of it related to technology. I will share my views about programming languages, about the tech industry, working methodologies, etc.
</p>
<h2>How is this website done?</h2>
<p>This website is done completely from scratch in Rust, no libraries, just bare Rust code. I write in markdown and I parse it to html with a parser. You can find the parser I wrote <a href="https://github.com/Davichet-e/md2html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> 
</p>


<p>I do!!!
<pre><code class='language-rust'>
fn function(parameter: u32) -> u8 {    parameter as u8}</code></pre></p>
<h3>Yet another section</h3>

<p>The question ends up being <code><b><i>why</i></b></code> not <b>how</b>
