# My new Blog!
{date: 2022/10/02}
{description: Since my first years of college, I always knew I would end up building my own blog from scratch. What I didn't know, is that it would take me so long to start to do it! But finally, I've decided to stop procrastinating it and start building it.}

Also since I've known the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org), I was sure I would end up building using it. I want to make it iteratively, starting with a minimal working version, without tags, comments etc. Just plain text, just a simple markdown to html. And whenever I want/have time, keep adding features.

## Why now?
I've recently moved to Barcelona, to work for Amazon, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to create my own blog, and share some of my views. (Opinions are my own (?))

## What will you write about?
About anything, probably most of it related to technology. I will share my views about programming languages, about the tech industry, working methodologies, etc.

## How is this website done?
This website is done completely from scratch in Rust, no libraries, just bare Rust code. I write in markdown and I parse it to html with a parser. You can find the parser I wrote [here](https://github.com/Davichet-e/md2html) 

## I have a question regarding the parser
If you have any question regarding my parser, feel free to post an issue on the repo. I'm sure I can learn a lot from your comments!

## Why not use a SSG (Static Site Generator) like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [11y](https://www.11ty.dev/)
I wanted to do it on my own, I was curious about how hard would it be to write my own markdown parser. Furthermore, if I were to "waste" my time building a blog, I preferred not to fight with a tool. If I wanted to customize anything, instead of going though docs, wikis, etc. I thought it would be on the long term just easier to do it on my own and customize it to my needs.

I do!!!
```rust
fn function(parameter: u32) -> u8 {
    parameter as u8
}
```

The question ends up being `*_why_*` not *how*
