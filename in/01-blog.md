# My new Blog
{date: 2024/10/02}
{description: Since my first years of college, I always knew I would end up building my own blog from scratch. What I didn't know, is that it would take me so long to start to do it! But finally, I've decided to stop procrastinating it and start building it.}


I want to make it iteratively, starting with a minimal working version, without tags, comments etc. Just plain text, just a simple markdown to html. And whenever I want/have time, keep adding features.

## Why now?
I've recently moved to Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, and I thought it was a good time to finally finish it. It was on my drawer of _almost_ done things for 2 years now!

## What will you write about?
About anything, probably most of it related to technology. I will share my views about programming languages, about the tech industry, working methodologies, etc.

## How is this website done?
This website is written with a custom Markdown parser written in Rust, no libraries, just bare Rust code. You can find the parser I wrote [here](https://github.com/Davichet-e/md2html) 

## I have a question regarding the parser
If you have any question regarding my parser, feel free to post an issue on the repo. I'm sure I can learn a lot from your comments!

## Why not use a SSG (Static Site Generator) like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [11y](https://www.11ty.dev/)
I wanted to do it on my own, I was curious about how hard would it be to write my own markdown parser. Furthermore, if I were to "waste" my time building a blog, I preferred not to fight with a tool. If I wanted to customize anything, instead of going though docs, wikis, etc. I thought it would be on the long term just easier to do it on my own and customize it to my needs.
